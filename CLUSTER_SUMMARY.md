# GaleraHealth - Cluster Health Summary

## Description

A final summary system has been implemented that analyzes the overall status of the Galera cluster and highlights critical issues that require attention.

## Summary Functionality

### 🎉 Perfect Health
When everything works correctly:
```
🎉 GALERA CLUSTER IN PERFECT HEALTH
   ✅ Configuration coherent across all nodes
   ✅ All MySQL/MariaDB nodes responding correctly
   ✅ All nodes synchronized and ready
   ✅ Cluster in Primary state

📊 Total nodes: 3
🔗 Active nodes: 3/3
```

### ❌ Critical Issues
When there are problems requiring immediate attention:
```
❌ CRITICAL ISSUES DETECTED:
   1. MySQL/MariaDB not responding on 1/3 nodes
   2. Nodes not synchronized: 1/2

📊 STATUS SUMMARY:
   🏠 Total nodes: 3
   ⚙️  Configuration coherent: ✅
   🔗 MySQL/MariaDB active: 2/3 ❌
   ✅ Nodes ready: 2/2 ✅
   🎯 Primary state: 2/2 ✅
   🔄 Nodes synchronized: 1/2 ❌

🚨 ACTION REQUIRED: Cluster has issues that need immediate attention
```

### ⚠️ Warnings
When there are minor issues:
```
⚠️  WARNINGS:
   1. Only 2/3 nodes in Primary state

📊 STATUS SUMMARY:
   🏠 Total nodes: 3
   ⚙️  Configuration coherent: ✅
   🔗 MySQL/MariaDB active: 3/3 ✅
   ✅ Nodes ready: 3/3 ✅
   🎯 Primary state: 2/3 ⚠️
   🔄 Nodes synchronized: 3/3 ✅

⚠️  ATTENTION: Cluster is functional but has minor warnings
```

## Types of Issues Detected

### Critical Issues (❌)
- **Incoherent configuration**: Differences in configuration between nodes
- **MySQL/MariaDB not responding**: Nodes where the database service is not active
- **Nodes not ready**: Nodes that are not in "ready" state
- **No nodes in Primary state**: Entire cluster is in non-Primary state
- **Nodes not synchronized**: Nodes that are not synchronized (not "Synced")

### Warnings (⚠️)
- **Only some nodes in Primary**: Some nodes are not in Primary state (but at least one is)

## Technical Implementation

### Code Location
- **Main function**: `displayClusterSummary()` in `display.go`
- **Integration**: Called from `main.go` after each analysis
- **Status detection**: Analyzes `ClusterAnalysis` and `GaleraClusterInfo` structures

### Evaluation Criteria

```go
// Configuration
if !analysis.IsCoherent {
    issues = append(issues, "Incoherent configuration")
}

// MySQL/MariaDB
if respondingNodes != totalNodes {
    issues = append(issues, "MySQL/MariaDB not responding on some nodes")
}

// Ready state
if readyNodes != respondingNodes {
    issues = append(issues, "Nodes not ready")
}

// Primary state
if primaryNodes == 0 {
    issues = append(issues, "No nodes in Primary state")
} else if primaryNodes != respondingNodes {
    warnings = append(warnings, "Only some nodes in Primary")
}

// Synchronization
if syncedNodes != respondingNodes {
    issues = append(issues, "Nodes not synchronized")
}
```

## Integration with Verbosity

The summary uses `logMinimal()` so it's always shown regardless of verbosity level:
- Displayed at **all** verbosity levels
- Provides critical information for decision making
- Facilitates rapid problem identification

## Use Cases

1. **Regular monitoring**: Quick identification of overall status
2. **Troubleshooting**: Detection of failing components
3. **Automation**: Easy-to-interpret format for scripts
4. **Auditing**: Complete cluster status summary at a point in time

## Example Output by Scenario

### Scenario 1: Single node (no coherence analysis)
```
📊 Total nodes: 1
🔗 MySQL/MariaDB: Not checked
```

### Scenario 2: Cluster without MySQL checked
```
📊 Total nodes: 3
⚙️  Configuration coherent: ✅
🔗 MySQL/MariaDB: Not checked
```

### Scenario 3: Cluster with mixed issues
```
❌ CRITICAL ISSUES DETECTED:
   1. MySQL/MariaDB not responding on 1/3 nodes

⚠️  WARNINGS:
   1. Only 2/3 nodes in Primary state
   
📊 STATUS SUMMARY: [detailed status]
```

The system provides a clear and actionable view of the Galera cluster status, facilitating rapid identification and resolution of problems.
