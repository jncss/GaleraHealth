# Localhost + Remote SSH Functionality

## Overview
GaleraHealth now supports enhanced localhost operation where users can start with `localhost` and still perform comprehensive cluster analysis by connecting to remote nodes via SSH.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Localhost Operation
- **Before**: Starting with `localhost` would skip remote nodes entirely
- **After**: Starting with `localhost` connects to remote nodes via SSH for complete cluster analysis

### 2. Intelligent Defaults
- **Multi-node Detection**: When localhost is used with a multi-node cluster configuration, the system defaults to performing cluster coherence analysis
- **Smart Prompting**: Shows `(Y/n)` for yes-default or `(y/N)` for no-default based on context

### 3. Seamless SSH Integration
- **Automatic Fallback**: Tries SSH keys first, then prompts for passwords
- **Credential Persistence**: Saves SSH credentials per node for future use
- **Mixed Authentication**: Supports different SSH methods per node

## Usage Examples

### Starting with Localhost
```bash
./galerahealth
Enter the Galera cluster node IP: localhost
# System detects local Galera configuration

Do you want to check cluster configuration coherence across all nodes? (Y/n) (default: Y): 
# Smart default: defaults to 'Y' for multi-node clusters

# System then connects to remote nodes:
   1. 10.1.1.91 (this is localhost - already analyzed)
   2. 10.1.1.92 - connecting...
      # Tries SSH keys, then prompts for password if needed
   3. 10.1.1.93 - connecting...
      # Uses saved credentials or prompts as needed
```

### Verbose Mode
```bash
./galerahealth -v
# Shows detailed connection process:
🔍 Multi-node cluster detected with localhost, defaulting to cluster analysis
🌐 Initial node is localhost, attempting SSH connection to remote node 10.1.1.92
🔍 Found saved credentials for node 10.1.1.92
🔑 Trying SSH keys for 10.1.1.92...
✓ Connected to 10.1.1.92 using SSH keys
```

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Modified Cluster Analysis Logic
```go
if connInfo.Username == "local" {
    // Before: Skip remote nodes
    // After: Attempt SSH connection to remote nodes
    logVerbose("🌐 Initial node is localhost, attempting SSH connection to remote node %s", nodeIP)
    sshClient, newConnInfo, err = createSSHConnectionWithNodeCredentials(nodeIP, config)
}
```

### 2. Intelligent Default Selection
```go
// When using localhost, default to checking cluster coherence 
// since user probably wants full analysis
defaultCoherence := config.LastCheckCoherence
if isLocalhost(nodeIP) && len(initialClusterInfo.ClusterAddress) > 0 && 
   strings.Contains(initialClusterInfo.ClusterAddress, ",") {
    defaultCoherence = true // Default to yes for localhost with multi-node cluster
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Boolean Prompts
```go
func promptForBoolWithDefault(message string, defaultValue bool) bool {
    defaultStr := "N"
    promptSuffix := "(y/N)"
    if defaultValue {
        defaultStr = "Y"
        promptSuffix = "(Y/n)"  // Shows correct default indicator
    }
    // ...
}
```

## Benefits

### 1. Improved User Experience
- **No More Limitations**: Users can start with localhost and still get complete cluster analysis
- **Intuitive Defaults**: System intelligently suggests cluster analysis for multi-node setups
- **Clear Feedback**: Enhanced prompts show what the default action will be

### 2. Operational Flexibility
- **Mixed Environments**: Perfect for environments where you have local access to one node but need SSH for others
- **Gradual Credential Collection**: System collects and saves SSH credentials as needed
- **Persistent Configuration**: Remembers preferences and credentials for future runs

### 3. Maintained Simplicity
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing workflows continue to work unchanged
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Advanced features are available but don't complicate basic usage
- **Secure by Default**: Maintains all existing security features (encrypted credential storage, etc.)

## Common Scenarios

### 1. First Time Setup
```bash
./galerahealth
Enter node IP: localhost
# System detects 3-node cluster, defaults to analysis
Do you want to check cluster coherence? (Y/n): [ENTER]
# System connects to remote nodes, prompts for SSH credentials
Enter SSH password for root@10.1.1.92: [password]
# Credentials saved and encrypted for future use
```

### 2. Subsequent Runs
```bash
./galerahealth
Enter node IP: localhost
# System uses saved preferences and credentials
Do you want to check cluster coherence? (Y/n): [ENTER]
# Automatic connection to all nodes using saved credentials
✅ All nodes analyzed successfully
```

### 3. Mixed Authentication
```bash
# Node 10.1.1.91: localhost (direct access)
# Node 10.1.1.92: SSH keys
# Node 10.1.1.93: SSH password
# All handled seamlessly by the credential management system
```

## Error Handling

### 1. SSH Connection Failures
- Clear error messages for connection issues
- Graceful fallback when nodes are unreachable
- Continues analysis with available nodes

### 2. Authentication Problems
- Intelligent retry with different authentication methods
- Clear prompts for password entry when SSH keys fail
- Credential validation and error reporting

### 3. Network Issues
- Timeout handling for unresponsive nodes
- Clear indication of which nodes are accessible
- Partial analysis results when some nodes fail

## Configuration Impact

### Saved Preferences
```json
{
  "last_check_coherence": true,  // Remembered preference
  "node_credentials": [
    {
      "node_ip": "10.1.1.92",
      "ssh_username": "root",
      "encrypted_ssh_password": "...",
      "uses_ssh_keys": false
    }
  ]
}
```

### Smart Defaults
- Localhost + multi-node cluster → Default to cluster analysis
- Single node cluster → Default to no additional analysis
- Previous user choice → Use last preference

## Summary

This enhancement transforms GaleraHealth from a tool with localhost limitations into a comprehensive cluster analysis solution that seamlessly combines local and remote access methods. Users get the convenience of starting locally with the power of complete cluster analysis through intelligent SSH connectivity.
